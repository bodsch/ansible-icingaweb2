## Why from sources?

The package offered by Icinga has a hard (and in my eyes unnecessary) dependency on Apache2.

This role also supports other distributions like ArchLinux, Gentoo by using the sources.

 - running mariadb / mysql database
 - PHP > 7.0
 - nginx

### Operating systems

Tested on

* Debian 10
* Ubuntu 18.04 / 20.04
